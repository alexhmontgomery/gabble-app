# Gabble

Gabble is a social media site that is similar to Twitter. It allows users to sign-up, log-in, and post messages (Gabs) for everyone to see that are 140 characters or less. Users are able to like other Gabs or delete Gabs that they have posted.
I created this project during my time at The Iron Yard coding bootcamp.
